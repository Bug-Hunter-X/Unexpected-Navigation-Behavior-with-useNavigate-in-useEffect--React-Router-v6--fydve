In React Router Dom v6, navigating using the useNavigate hook within a useEffect hook that runs only once (e.g., on component mount) can lead to unexpected behavior.  If the navigation depends on asynchronous operations within useEffect, the navigation might happen after the component has already unmounted.  This results in a warning in the console or, depending on how navigation is implemented, it may cause a React state update error.
